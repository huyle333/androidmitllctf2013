Android Code from the MIT LL CTF 2013
===================
Interesting code used in the Android MIT LL CTF 2013. The code is for some review. Basically, teams pushed their Android app code onto the MIT LL CTF's appstore to retrieve flags and steal flags. Each Android app served like a challenge, and teams could decide to secure their apps or make them carry malicious activity. Each app also had a separate function. The files included are in their apk project packages signed and zipaligned.
